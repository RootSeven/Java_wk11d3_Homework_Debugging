# What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
Breakpoint causes the program to pause before the line the breakpoint is on. You can see the properties of objects at that point.

# Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No.

# How do we debug the next line of code?
Click Step Over, which will run the line the breakpoint is on and pause before the next line.

# What does the step into command do?
If you Step Over, you will move onto and execute the next line of code. By using Step Into, you can go into the next method and stop at the first line of that method.

# What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate Expression: gives the result of a single line of code
Evaluate Code Fragment: gives the result of several lines of code, and allows the user to store temporary variables.
